APPROACH:
1) Storage engine keeps track of all valid SM_FileHandle
   (in a array of pointers) that can use read and write API's.

2) Every API's checks if storage manager is initialized +
   check if given SM_FileHandle is valid and then proceed.

3) ensureCapacity() does not need to write zeroblock to
   each and every block till the numOfPages requests.
   Eg: If we have 5 blocks in a file and we invoke
       ensureCapacity() with numOfPages=10. It is enough
       to write the 10 block along. The 6,7,8,9th block
       are created automatically and is assigned to
       zerobytes, this is unix behavior. (Mostly other OS too).

4) Additional error message are added to enable clarify.

5) Valgrind is run on test_assign1_1. Fixes are made.
